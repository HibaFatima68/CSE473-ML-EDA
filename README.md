# Assignment 1 - CSE473: Introduction to Machine Learning

This repo contains my work for Assignment 1 in CSE473 (Introduction to Machine Learning).  
The main goal was to practice Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by closely examining a dataset and using automated tools to find alerts and data quality issues.  

## Dataset Choice  
I selected the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset from many options provided.  
This dataset has 569 samples with 32 numeric features describing cell nuclei, and the target is Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign).  

## Work Done  
- Loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed the data.  
- Explored feature correlations and distributions.  
- Visualized data using AutoViz and ydata-profiling tools.  
- Built and evaluated a Logistic Regression model for diagnosis classification.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
3. Run the notebook or scripts to reproduce the analysis and model training.
